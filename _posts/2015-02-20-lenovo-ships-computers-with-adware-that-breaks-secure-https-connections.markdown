![Man In The Middle attack illustration]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/man-in-the-middle-attack.png)
Yesterday we discovered Lenovo is pre-installing adware on notebooks that uses a “man-in-the-middle” attack to break secure connections on affected laptops to get access to sensitive data and inject advertising. To make things worse, Lenovo installed a weak certificate into the system in a way that means affected users cannot trust any secure connections.

Received a new computer from Lenovo? Until 1st March, **we are offering a [50% discount for a remote malware removal on affected Lenovo systems](https://itsolver.net/contact/)** as listed below. That's only $29.50 for malware removal. Alternatively for a free vulnerability check visit [https://filippo.io/Badfish/.](https://filippo.io/Badfish/)

Unfortunately corporate spying like this is the tip 0f the iceberg as we discovered from the [Snowden leaks](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/inside-the-nsa-s-war-on-internet-security-a-1010361.html) that all Windows and Mac computers have backdoors for government spies which then allow criminals in.

**The complete solution is to take back control of your hardware and software. Today we have the [Novena](https://www.crowdsupply.com/kosagi/novena-open-laptop) and in the not to distant future, [Purism Librem 15 laptop.](https://puri.sm/)**
