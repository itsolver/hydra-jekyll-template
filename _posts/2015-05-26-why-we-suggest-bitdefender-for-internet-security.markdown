# Best in protection, performance and usability
We regularly check independent test results of internet security solutions at [AV-Test](http://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/) and [AV-Comparatives](http://www.av-comparatives.org/dynamic-tests/) where we see year after year Bitdefender is reviewed as #1 in protection, performance and ease of use.


# Good value


Annual licence for Bitdefender Internet Security is $49 at IT Solver (save $50 off RRP). Installation is an optional $30 or install it yourself for free. Of course you could use [free anti-virus](http://r.duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com.au%2Fsolutions%2Ffree.html) however if you shop online or do Internet banking then paid Internet Security is essential otherwise you leave your self wide open to fraudulent attackers.


# Quiet protection


We are all too busy these days to be bothered by unnecessary notifications and that's why we prefer the way Bitdefender blocks threats with little fuss.
