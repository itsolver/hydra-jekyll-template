**Update: The technical preview is now [available for download](http://preview.windows.com/)!**
Earlier today [Microsoft announced](http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2014/09/30/announcing-windows-10/) the next release of Windows after 8/8.1 will not be called Windows 9, instead, Windows 10. Why not 9? Because seven, eight, ten.

Pun joke aside, we look forward to tomorrow (October 2) when the [Windows 10 technical preview](http://preview.windows.com) is made public. This is an unfinished version of Windows 10 for technology enthusiasts to get a glimpse of the new operating system before it is released in late 2015. For our customers, this next release couldn't come sooner as Windows 8 has been far from a pleasant user experience.

We believe Windows 7 is better than Windows 8/8.1 for people using non-touch devices, i.e. a computer with a keyboard and mouse. However, Windows 10 may meld the solid features of Windows 7 with the modern improvements of Windows 8.


Watch Windows VP Joe Belfiore talk about some of the features in Windows 10, like the new Start menu, multiple desktops, and improved multi-tasking.
