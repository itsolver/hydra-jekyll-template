<p>IT Solver is a team of one. Angus McLauchlan realised early on it was more rewarding to work as a one man band.</p>
<p>Angus works hard to empathise with others to solve real problems and build a service that he can be proud of.</p>
<p>Using tools like <a href="/cloud-apps-g-suite">G Suite</a>, Xero, Receipt-Bank, Zapier and Hazel, Angus automated the most tedious parts of his day to day job.</p>
<p>Angus believes there are jobs that a computer is best at doing and that there are jobs that a human is best at doing. Angus wants to empower businesses to create workflows that let computers do what they are best at doing and let humans do what they are best at doing.</p>
<p>IT Solver finds your business the right tools so you can have 10X the impact with less work.</p>
