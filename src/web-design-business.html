faq:
 - question: When do I pay for the website?
   answer: Our one month free trial has no setup fees, meaning you can get started right away without any payment.
 - question: What happens at the end of the one month free trial period?
   answer: At the end of your free trial, you credit card is automatically charged and you get to keep your website and domain (for just $39/month). However, if you decide to cancel, any services we've deployed will be removed (meaning you won't have access to them anymore).
 - question: How quickly will my website be built?
   answer: Once you have shared enough information about your business via a simple survey, our team will get started on the website build. This typically takes between 5 to 10 business days. During the free trial, you can evaluate and review your website before launching into a paid subscription plan.
 - question: Who registers and hosts my website domain?
   answer: We’ll take care of the domain name registration, hosting and the other technical details based on your business goals.
 - question: Do I have to sign up for a contract?
   answer: We offer a flexible payment plan. You are billed monthly.
 - question: What happens when I cancel?
   answer: If you choose to cancel your paid subscription plan (after your one month free trial) we’ll delete the website and domain. You’ll have the opportunity to reinstate them within 30 days by moving to a paid subscription plan.
 - question: Can I use this product if I already have a website?
   answer: Yes, we can use any your existing content (text, images only) to build you a new website. But, note that your new mobile-friendly website will be built using our templates and technology and may not have the same look and feel as your old website.
 - question: If I have more product-related questions, who can I contact?
   answer: Please email us at <a href="mailto:support@itsolver.net">support@itsolver.net</a> or call <a href="tel:+61731236000">(07) 3123 6000</a> between 8 am and 6 pm (AEST) Monday - Friday.
