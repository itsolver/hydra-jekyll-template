Want to know if GCHQ spied on you? Now you can find out. Privacy International (PI) has just [launched a website](https://www.privacyinternational.org) that lets anyone find out if their communications were intercepted by the NSA and then shared with GCHQ.

The website is the result of a February 6 ruling by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT). Similar to the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/08/what-you-need-know-about-fisa-court-and-how-it-needs-change) in the US, the IPT is a special court in the UK established by the [Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_of_Investigatory_Powers_Act_2000) (RIPA) that deals with issues of surveillance and human rights.
