More than a decade ago, Google introduced Gmail—the first cloud-native productivity app—to help make email safer and easier for everyone. Since then, we pioneered more ways for teams to collaborate in real-time with products like Google Calendar, Docs, Drive and Hangouts. Together, these apps make up [G Suite](/cloud-apps-g-suite), a set of intelligent, secure productivity and collaboration tools.

Google brought businesses more than a dozen new G Suite services to help them reimagine how they work, including powerful [video conferencing](https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/bring-teams-together-new-g-suite-integrations/) (Hangouts Meet), [secure team messaging](https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/move-projects-forward-one-placehangouts-chat-now-available/) (Hangouts Chat) and enterprise-grade [search capabilities](https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/introducing-google-cloud-search-g-suite/) (Cloud Search). Google also infused our products with advanced [artificial intelligence](https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/how-machine-learning-g-suite-makes-people-more-productive/) to make it easier to [respond to emails](https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/subject-write-emails-faster-smart-compose-gmail/), [gather insights from data](https://www.blog.google/products/docs/explore-docs-sheets-and-slides/) and [protect against phishing attacks](https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/helping-g-suite-customers-stay-secure-new-proactive-phishing-protections-and-management-controls/) before they happen.

Over the last ten years, G Suite has grown to provide more tools, functionality and value to help businesses transform the way they work. The one thing that hasn't changed over this time, is the price. 
<br/>
Today we are announcing two incremental list prices updates in line with Google to reflect this value. Starting on April 2, 2019, the list price of [G Suite Basic edition](/cloud-apps-g-suite/#pricing) will increase from $5 AUD to $8.40 AUD (ex GST) per user per month, and the list price of [G Suite Business edition](/cloud-apps-g-suite/#pricing) will increase from $10 AUD to $16.80 AUD (ex GST) per user per month (or the local currency equivalent where applicable). These increases will apply globally with local market adjustments and limited time discounts for certain regions.

For existing G Suite Basic or Business edition customers, the new list prices will go into effect on April 2, 2019. These changes will not impact current contracts or any renewal events prior to April 2, 2019.

We are grateful for our business customers that use G Suite to empower their teams to work collaboratively, and we remain committed to supporting its functionality to help our customers succeed.
