IT Solver is pleased to announce we received [QAssure accreditation](https://qassure.com.au/supplier/details/13046) from CCIQ – Queensland’s peak business body.

This accreditation is a process which seeks to easily connect, contract ready and qualified ICT suppliers with public and private sector organisations seeking their services.

The approval is not given without considerable checks and balances. Only ICT suppliers that are credible and fit for purpose are accredited. As a result, the QAssure tick of approval gives vendors confidence the businesses we list are registered, insured, viable and don't have ASIC form.
