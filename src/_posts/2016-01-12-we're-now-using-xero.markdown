We're delighted to announce we have upgraded our accounting software to [Xero.](https://www.xero.com/accounting-software/){:rel="nofollow"} What is Xero I hear you ask? Well, Xero is online accounting software for your small business.

We believe this upgrade will enable us to grow our business and maintain the high level of customer satisfaction we work so hard to achieve.

Feedback we received when using [Freshbooks](https://itsolver.freshbooks.com/tryfreshbooks/www){:rel="nofollow"} for invoicing was that some customers prefer to receive the invoice as a pdf attachment. We're glad to satisfy this request with invoices sent via Xero, while still offering the ability to view and pay your bill online.

All the best for the year ahead.
