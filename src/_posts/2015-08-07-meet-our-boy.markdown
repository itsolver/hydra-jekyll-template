**Update: Now back to work and responding to the mountain of requests. Thanks for your patience.**

I am proud and delighted to announce my fiancé, Bonnie, gave birth to a healthy boy. His name is Cameron Aart McLauchlan. At birth, Cameron weighed in at a healthy 4.31kg (4lb 8oz) and measured 53cm long.

To enjoy these precious moments ahead, I will be away from IT Solver to return Friday 21st August.

Thank you for the consideration.
