We're happy to announce our newest drop-off and pick-up location available at My Health Aisle, Russell Island's health food store and wellness clinic. Whether you need a health boost for yourself or your computer, say hello to Kirsty Holmes, the owner of My Health Aisle.

At IT Solver we're always striving to deliver value and a walk-in location at Russell Island will do exactly this - saving our customers $40 compared to on-site support. Residents and visitors of Macleay Island still have the option of dropping off their device at Macleay Island Data Services (Bendigo Bank).

For more information or technical questions, please call Angus on 3123 6000 or [submit a request online.](https://support.itsolver.net/hc/en-au/requests/new){:rel="nofollow"}
