In light of the Facebook scandal this week, I have deleted my Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp accounts. It feels great!

Facebook for me was mostly promoting my business and connecting with my family, but I have alternatives.

Here I detail how I freed myself from Facebook surveillance, and at the end I have included alternative apps to Facebook.

### Understand your options
You have a choice to make if you want to get off Facebook: [deactivate or delete](https://www.facebook.com/help/359046244166395/). Deactivating is temporary — you can return to the site at any time. Deleting is forever — much (not necessarily [all](https://www.facebook.com/help/224562897555674/?ref=u2u)) of your content disappears, and you can’t ever get it back.

### Be sure you’re ready
Your account might be tied to other apps like Spotify. [Review apps](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications) you're logged in with Facebook. These apps generally let you change to signing in with an email address.
Initially I was going to only clamp down on apps I've signed in with Facebook, but I'm fed up with the way my data has been used.

### Download a copy of your data
1. Go to [https://www.facebook.com/settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings)
2. Under General, choose Download a copy of your Facebook data.
3. Click the green "Start My Archive" button.

### Let your friends and family know you're leaving Facebook
No doubt your friends and family will be curious why. It's a good chance to invite them to alternative apps.

### Delete your Facebook account
1. Go to [https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account](https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account)
2. Take a deep breath and click the “Delete My Account” option. 

Facebook will let you recover your account for two weeks, but it’ll get to work on its 90-day process of scrubbing you from the site.

### Remove other Facebook apps Instagram and Whatsapp
