This question comes up a lot, so here is the answer with links for more information and where to buy.

[MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/au/macbook-air/){:rel="nofollow"}. The latest version priced from $1499. I bought mine in early 2014. This laptop is still a delight to use, it's light and has an all day battery. If you're frequently on the go, consider the [MacBook](https://www.apple.com/au/macbook/){:rel="nofollow"}. Want more grunt for demanding tasks? Look at the [MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/au/macbook-pro/){:rel="nofollow"}.

Prefer Windows? [Dell XPS 13](http://www.dell.com/en-au/shop/dell-laptops/sc/laptops/xps-laptops){:rel="nofollow"} is a favourite, from $1499. Often there is 20% off at [Dell's official eBay Store](http://stores.ebay.com.au/Official-Dell-Australia-Store/_i.html?_nkw=xps&submit=Search&_trksid=p4634.c0.m310&_sid=664002315){:rel="nofollow"}. Check out the [Verge review of the XPS 13 (2018)](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17125558/dell-xps-13-review-2018-laptop-battery-specs-price){:rel="nofollow"}.

Schools in Australia are using Chromebooks, they’re great value, secure,  easy to use and manage. They’re also great candidates for business.  Unfortunately, Chromebooks with a screen larger than 11 inches are rare.

At work or university, if I had a MacBook Air or Dell XPS 13, I’d be a happy chappy.
