  Statewide Roofing has high standards applied from customer service to the tidy and timely finish of projects, however large or small.
  Existing email and file storage infrastructure were on-premises and due for an upgrade.
  Chris Rice, keen to migrate the existing infrastructure to the cloud, started a conversation with IT Solver.
solution: |
  The email was migrated to Office 365, files moved into Sharepoint Online. At the same time, we also deployed new laptops to the staff with everything ready to go.
